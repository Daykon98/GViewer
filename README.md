This is a simple page that uses PHP, raw Javascript, HTML and a SQL database to show some interactive graphs for this Kaggle's dataset https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016.

This was done as a university project, so forgive my past self if you would be so kind. To set it up, use Apache to serve the PHP,create a database in MySQL with the file given in mysql, and finally change the parameters of the connection in includes/DBConnection.php. 

If you want to use this (for some reason) and have any issue, please make an issue and I will try to help.
